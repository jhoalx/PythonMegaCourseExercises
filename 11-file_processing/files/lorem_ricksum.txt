Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something? Wait, the whole time? I was screaming for help, and you stayed on the roof? He's not pressing charges. That's gotta be the you shot me equivalent of not being mad.

I mixed in some praying mantis DNA. You know a praying mantis is the exact opposite of a vole, Morty? They mate once and then bluergh cut each other's heads off. There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds who refuse to admit they're Christian. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty!

Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. Puffy vagina. Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up.

Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that. Ohh yea, you gotta get schwifty. I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?! I couldn't hear you over my own screaming. We've talked about this!
